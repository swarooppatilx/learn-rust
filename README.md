# Learn Rust

Welcome to the **Learn Rust** repository! ðŸš€ This repository is designed to help you get started with Rust, an empowering systems programming language that guarantees memory safety without garbage collection and provides excellent performance.

## Resources

This repository is based on the official Rust programming language book: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). It is structured chapter by chapter to mirror the content of the book, making it easy for you to follow along and practice as you learn.

## Repository Structure

Each branch in this repository corresponds to a chapter from the book. For example:

- **`ch1`**: Chapter 1
- **`ch2`**: Chapter 2
- ... and so on.

You can switch between branches to explore the code and concepts introduced in each chapter.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
